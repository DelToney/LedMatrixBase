This is an example project that allows someone to set up an LED matrix out of a single strip of addressable LED's and translate that strip into a matrix. The idea behind this is to serve as a template for future projects, and allow for quick replication of projects.

This library was made when I made the Kaomoji Matrix, and was a huge learning process, so let me know if there are any bugs in the code!

Necessary Libraries:

FastLED ver 3.2.8 (Ver 3.2.10 was throwing me weird errors for my feather (Probably something between it and AtmelSAM), so your milage may vary) https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/releases/tag/3.2.8
LEDMatrix https://github.com/Jorgen-VikingGod/LEDMatrix


Boring legal stuff, use the project however you want!
